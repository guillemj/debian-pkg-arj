    embedded into arj itself, so that we finally get reproducible output.

arj (3.10.22-21) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Instead of fixing up unreproducible metadata in the help.arj embedded
    into the arj program, just stop recording its file attributes altogether.
  * Update debian/rules:
    - Rename conf_gnu_type to confflags.
    - Fold DEBUG and STRIP variables into a single buildvars, so that we do
      not stomp over make variables with incompatible semantics.
  * Fix cross-building support:
    - Set CROSS_BUILDING variable during configure.
    - Set CC_FOR_BUILD variable during configure.
    - Check for a strip build tool during configure, and use that instead of
      hardcoding "strip" in the makefile.
    - Use CC_FOR_BUILD for all tools executed at build time.
    - When cross-building build an additional arj program for the build
      architecture, so that we can execute it to compress the help.arj that
      we embed into the host arj.
    - Include dpkg's buildtools.mk and pass CC and CC_FOR_BUILD to the build
      system.
    - Remove now obsolete comment about upstream build system not supporting
      cross-building.
  * Update debian/watch:
    - Use tabs as field delimiters.
    - Remove outdated heading field titles.
    - Match on .xz in addition to .gz, even if it's unlikely upstream will
      release such a thing.
  * Switch to Standards-Version 4.4.0 (no changes needed).
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 12.
  * Switch from debian/compat to debhelper-commpat in Build-Depends.

  * Move location of GPL-2 in Debian systems into a Comment field in
    debian/copyright.

    generated makefile. Thanks to Helmut Grohne <helmut@subdivi.de>.
